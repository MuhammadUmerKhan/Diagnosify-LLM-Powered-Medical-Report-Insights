Question: hi
Answer: \U0001f60a Hi there! I'm here to help you understand your medical report. How are you doing today? \U0001f917 

It looks like you've had a test done for HbA1c, which measures your average blood sugar levels over time. Let's take a closer look at the results together!

Question: what's my report tells?
Answer: \U0001f60a Hi Asad! I've got your report right here. Let's take a look together. 

Your HBA1C (Glycosylated Hemoglobin) test result is 9.90%. This test measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. 

According to your report, a normal result is less than 5.7%. A result between 5.7-6.4% is considered pre-diabetic, and a result above 6.5% is considered diabetic.

Since your result is 9.90%, it means your blood sugar levels have been higher than normal over the past few months. Don't worry, this doesn't mean you have diabetes right now, but it does mean you might be at risk or potentially have diabetes. \U0001f4aa

It's really important to talk to your doctor, Dr. [referred by], about these results and what they mean for your health. They can help you understand what's going on and create a plan to get your blood sugar levels under control. \U0001f495

You're taking the first step by getting checked, and that's something to be proud of! \U0001f389 Keep in mind that I'm here to support you, and you can always ask me any questions you have about your report. \U0001f60a What do you think about talking to your doctor next?
